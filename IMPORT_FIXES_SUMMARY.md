# Import Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed `resource_filename("lllm", ...)` call
**Problem**: The `path_prefix()` method in `questions_loaders.py` tried to use `resource_filename("lllm", ...)` but the 'lllm' module wasn't found as a package.

**Solution**: Replaced the `resource_filename` approach with a simple `os.path` based solution:

```python
@staticmethod
def path_prefix():
    # Get the directory of the current file (questions_loaders.py)
    # Then navigate up to get to the data/ld directory
    import os
    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    # current_dir is now /path/to/SPAR/src/data/ld/lllm
    # We want to go back to /path/to/SPAR/src/data/ld
    prefix = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
    
    return prefix
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed relative imports in `questions_loaders.py`
**Problem**: The file had absolute imports for local modules:
```python
from dialogue_classes import Suspect, DynamicInvestigator, Dialogue, StaticInvestigator
from utils import completion_create_retry
```

**Solution**: Changed to relative imports:
```python
from .dialogue_classes import Suspect, DynamicInvestigator, Dialogue, StaticInvestigator
from .utils import completion_create_retry
```

### 3. ✅ Removed unnecessary pkg_resources dependency
**Problem**: The file imported `pkg_resources` which was only used for the faulty `resource_filename` call.

**Solution**: Removed the import:
```python
# Removed pkg_resources import - using os.path instead
```

### 4. ✅ Fixed import in main.py
**Problem**: The import used a dot prefix which wouldn't work when running main.py directly.

**Solution**: Changed from:
```python
from .data.ld.lllm.questions_loaders import Sciq
```

To:
```python
from data.ld.lllm.questions_loaders import Sciq
```

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run from project root with PYTHONPATH
```bash
cd /home/borneans/Documents/SPAR
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/src"
python3 src/main.py
```

### Option 2: Run with sys.path modification
Add this to the top of your script:
```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'src'))

# Now you can import
from data.ld.lllm.questions_loaders import Sciq
```

### Option 3: Install as development package
```bash
cd /home/borneans/Documents/SPAR
pip install -e .
```

## Remaining Dependencies
The code still requires these external dependencies:
- `openai>=1.109.1`
- `pandas>=1.24.0` 
- `numpy>=1.24.0`
- `scipy>=1.3.0`
- `tqdm>=4.65.0`
- `transformers>=4.30.0`
- `retry>=0.9.2`
- `tenacity>=9.1.2`
- `python-dotenv>=1.1.1`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install openai pandas numpy scipy tqdm transformers retry tenacity python-dotenv
```

Or using the project's requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or if using uv:
uv sync
```

## Validation
All core import issues have been resolved. The remaining errors in the codebase are primarily:
1. Missing external dependencies (easily fixed with pip install)
2. Some type annotation issues (don't affect runtime)
3. Some code logic issues (not related to imports)

The main import problems that were causing `ModuleNotFoundError` have been fixed.
